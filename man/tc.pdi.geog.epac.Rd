\title{Hurricane Observations from the NATL and EPAC basins with Geographical Data}
\format{A data frame with 594 rows and 18 variables}
\usage{
data(tc.pdi.geog.epac)
}
\description{
A dataset containing summarised hurricane/tropical-cyclone observations from the Northeast
Pacific (1986-2016) basin with additional geographic variables.
}
\details{
The variables are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item storm.id: Unique storm ID. Constructed by basin (chars. 1-2) + ATCF cyclone number for that year (chars. 3-4) + Year (chars. 5-8).
  \item storm.name: Name, if available, or else "UNNAMED".
  \item n.obs: Number of best track entries.
  \item storm.duration: Lifetime of the storm in seconds.
  \item storm.pdi: Power-dissipation index. An indicator of the released energy of a hurricane, it integrates (cubic) wind speed over tropical-cyclone lifetime.
  \item max.wind: supremum of the maximum sustained surface wind speed.
  \item mean.wind: mean of the maximum sustained surface wind speed.
  \item mean.sq.wind: mean of the squared maximum sustained surface wind speed.
  \item storm.year: Year of storm occurrence.
  \item basin: EPAC (Northeast Pacific), this column is kept for structure consistency.
  \item sst: Annual and basin-wide averaged sea surface temperature.
  \item sst.norm: Normalised SST.
  \item sst.class: low for sst.norm < 1, high for sst.norm >= 1.
  \item first.lat: Genesis latitude of the storm.
  \item last.lat: Death latitude of the storm.
  \item first.long: Genesis longitude of the storm.
  \item last.long: Death latitude of the storm.
  \item distance: Path length of the storm. Calculated using the Spherical Law of Cosines.
}

The hurricane data (variables 1-9, 14-18) comes from the HURDAT2, while the SST is calculated from the HadISST1 (variables 11-13).
